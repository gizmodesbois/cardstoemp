## Hi There, fellow geek

As you may, or not know tomorrow, the 22 march 2019 will be the birthday of our friend, colleague, teacher [@jeromecoupe](https://twitter.com/jeromecoupe)

As members of the web development community, we propose to make him a very special gift to celebrate this special occasion.

We are going to send him a "Stoemp" composed of pretty much anything the web of today can do. We are a bit late to the party so please share this with anyone who might be interested in participating. We plan on sending a netlify link to him at the 22/03/2019 at 7pm

## How to use it

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to contribute

Create a new page inside the `/pages` directory. You can take the `home.md` as reference. You can also create your own layouts inside the `_includes/layouts` directory. Don't forget to add the right informations for the page (link, meta, ...)

## How to submit

Create a new branch and submit a PR to the project.

## Constraints

Please scope your added css to your own `<section>` to avoid side effects, each section will be displayed within a `100vw, 100vh` container.
