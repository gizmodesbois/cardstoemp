Lets face it, sending birthday cards is so 2018. But still, we want to find a way to congratulate JÃ©rome for the great person he is. 
That's why we ([Simon](https://twitter.com/henrottesimon) and [Julien](https://twitter.com/thylo)) thought about sending him a "Stoemp" of pages created by his friend. It can contain pretty much any thing you want, it doesn't have to be the nicest webpage you've ever made, it just have to be a part of you.

We are saddly a bit late to the party so please share this with anyone who might be interested in participating. We plan on sending a netlify link to him the 22/03/2019 at 7pm

## How to use it

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to contribute

Please DM [Simon](https://twitter.com/henrottesimon) or [Julien](https://twitter.com/thylo) with your github handle and we'll add you to the super secret repository we've created.
 
Create a new page inside the `/pages` directory. You can take the `home.md` as reference. You can also create your own layouts inside the `_includes/layouts` directory. Don't forget to add the right informations for the page (link, meta, ...)

## How to submit

Create a new branch and submit a PR to the project.

## Constraints

Please scope your added css to your own `<section>` to avoid side effects, each section will be displayed within a `100vw, 100vh` container.
